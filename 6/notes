####  Some examples of popular conditions  ####   ---> refer practice.sh file 

note:- commands 4 & 5 yield the same result but have slighly different syntax
---

create_dir.sh   # This is not a proper code coz the last line won't even be read by bash coz script terminates before.
# hence refer "create_dir_file.sh" on how to properly write the code.
---

combining multiple conditions with and & or statements
---

# Note:-
$#    # --> this tells no. of args you have passed to your script

# check if the directory exists, if it doesnot exist create directory. If for some reason, dir creation fails, print "cannot create directory" & do exit 1 because there's no point in continuing with this script anymore.
if [[ ! -d ${directory_name} ]]; then
    mkdir ${directory_name} || { echo "Cannot create directory"; exit 1; }

Note:-
if [[ ! -d
write -d first & then give ! # --> make this a habit coz it's easy to remember

# ||  ---> this denotes 'or' operation / statement
---

# Note:- do bash -x & see what commands its reading & executing
---

# Note:-
In command line usage when arguments are in <> they are required arguments and if the arguments are in [] they are optional.
