All scripts (script files) should have execute (x) permission. --> chmod +x helloworld.sh
----

Q) How does the system know we are executing a shell/bash script?
A) Every shell script needs to start with #!/bin/bash -> by reading this, system knows it's a shell script & to run this script, it takes an executable from that path (#!/bin/bash) & runs it using bash.

Note:-
Similarly if a script starts with #!/usr/bin/python3, the system knows it's a python script & takes the executable from that path & runs it using python.

----

./helloworld.sh -> in my current directory, run a script called helloworld.sh (. denotes current directory) --> # use ./ before the filename

----

# In shell the character which we use to denote comments is #

----

ls -R 
ls --recursive
# Both these commands give same result. They list the files/folders of the current directory recursively.
