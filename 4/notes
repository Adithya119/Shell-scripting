###  Scope of variables  ###   ---> ( refer blog for explaination ) 

The default scope of a variable which is defined in a script is within the same script file.   

However, if needed, you can export the variable in script-1 over to external scripts (script-2) using "export" statement.  # "export" statement should be in script-1 .

Other way to export is using "args" on the command line --->   ./script2.sh $name   # here, $name is the var we are exporting from script-1 to script-2. But, I would prefer the "export" statement method to export.

###  Debugging your scripts  ###

bash -v    ## this displays both input & output statements

bash -x    ## 1st it is evaluating basename, then in 2nd line, it is replacing the basename with it's value (executable)
# This way shows how the commands are evaluated. Very useful when conditional statements are there in your script.
