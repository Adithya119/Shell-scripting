####  Looping constructs in bash scripting  ####

c lang styled for loop --> (a b c d) --> array of vars

## when in doubt about the syntax, just google for "bash 'for' loop examples" --> cyberciti.biz & search for ssh

# Basic for loop syntax:-
for
do


done

# IFS:-

# By default the IFS value has one of (space, newline or tab)

# this script takes 'space' as IFS because 'space' is the default IFS
1st script:- it's treating each word (which doesn't have space within it) as item coz when it sees a space, it prints the next word in a separate line.    

# the only diff in 2nd script is that we are making 'newline' as the default IFS (IFS=$'\n').
2nd script:- print each line as a line & dont break each word into a line   # this is called - iteration over lines
