#       (ii) Passing arrays as args to a Function
#       (iii) Variable scope
#       (iv)  Returning values from functions

----

# An Array in shell is something that can be defined within paranthesis - ( )
ex:- array_1=(value1 value2 . . . value-n)  --> refer all the .sh files


(ii)
Passing arrays as args to a Function:-

$@ --> # with this you will get all the parameters that were passed to the script ( refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9994295/what-does-mean-in-a-shell-script )

$@ = stores all the arguments as a list of arguements
$* = stores all the arguments as a single string
$# = stores the no. of arguments

*********************************
Always use $@ inside " " to avoid errors  ---> "$@"
*********************************

# All the scripts in this folder are trial and error & just for understanding.

# Note:-
A globally defined 'array' will be available inside a function even though you have not passed that array as a parameter/arg to that function while calling it.

A locally defined 'array' (inside function) will be available outside the function as well.   ----> refer 'arrays_are_global.sh'

****** Hence, an array, by default is global ******

If your array has to be local to a function, you have to explicitly mention it.    ----> refer 'local_arrays.sh'
--

When you re-define an existing array with new values, there will not be any conflict, but old values of that array will be overwritten by the new values. ----------> refer the 2 'array-conflict.sh' files.


# look at blog for few more commands

(iii) 
Variable scope:-

With shell scripting, just like an array, a variable defined inside a function becomes a global variable just like a variable which was defined outside the function.

******** Hence, in shell scripting every variable is a global variable "by default".   *********   ---> refer 'variable_scope.sh'

This is not the case with programming languages like C, Java, python etc,.. where a variable defined inside a function only has scope within that function, which actually makes sense.
 
If your variable has to be local to a function, you have to explicitly mention it.

(iv)
Returning values from functions:-

Return value from a function using the 'return' keyword
