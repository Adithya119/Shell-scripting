#       (ii) Passing arrays as args to a Function
#       (iii) Variable scope
#       (iv)  Returning values from functions

# An Array in shell is something that can be defined within paranthesis - ( )
ex:- array_1=(value1 value2 . . . value-n)  --> refer all the .sh files


(ii)
Passing arrays as args to a Function:-

$@ --> # with this you will get all the parameters that were passed to the script ( refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9994295/what-does-mean-in-a-shell-script )

# All the scripts in this folder are trial and error & just for understanding.

# look at blog for few more commands

(iii) 
Variable scope:-

With shell scripting, a variable defined inside a function becomes a global variable just like a variable which was defined outside the function.   # This is not the case with programming languages like C, Java, python etc,.. where a variable defined inside a function only has scope within that function, which actually makes sense.

Hence, in shell scripting every variable is a global variable "by default". 
If your variable has to be local to a function, you have to explicitly mention it.

(iv)
Returning values from functions:-

Return value from a function using the 'return' keyword
