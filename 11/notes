#      (iv) Returning Text from functions

# Exercise-1: 
# Exercise-2: 

----


(iv) 
Returning Text from functions:-

Because variables are global, you can just reference the var (which was defined inside the function) even outside the function.

********
# Note:- In bash it's for sure not possible to 'return' a string using return keyword. 
The return keyword can only return exit/return codes.
********

Hence to return a string or text, you have to hack it. Instead of using 'return' inside a function, use 'echo'
There are 2 possible ways to hack it. --> refer blog for it.

3rd approach is to export it using env variables. --> not in blog

Q) Interview question:
Can we return a string from a shell script or from a function inside it?
A) No, not by default. But yes, by hacking it using the above 2 possible ways.

(v)
Recursive functions:-           # you might not even write this but it's good to know

# Definition:-
A function that calls itself is a recursive function.

# classic example for recursive function is 'factorial' ---> 1 arg is enough for this
# You might be asked about this function in interviews but you rarely use this in organizations

$(( )) --> for arithmetic expressions

----


# Exercises:
For both these exercises, use functions & only give 2 args.

For exercise-1, you can use curl or wget
