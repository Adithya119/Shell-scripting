(iv) 
Returning Text from functions:-

********
# Note:- In bash it's for sure not possible to 'return' a string using return keyword. 
The return keyword can only return exit/return codes.
********

Hence to return a string or text, you have to hack it. Instead of using 'return' inside a function, use 'echo'
There are 2 possible ways to hack it. --> refer blog for it OR refer below:--

# solution 1: Using global variables:
Because variables are global, a variable which was defined inside a function, can be referenced outside that function as well. This is the simplest form of returning text from a function. -------> refer 'return_text.sh' for simplest form. Refer below similar files with minor modifications. 
Approach is "start simple, complicate later":-
'2-return_text.sh'
.
.
'5-return_text.sh'

# solution 2: Read the output
refer 'read_the_output.sh'

# 3rd approach is to export it using env variables. --> not in blog

Q) Interview question:
Can we return a string from a shell script or from a function inside it?
A) No, not by default. But yes, by hacking it using the above 2 possible ways.

(v)
Recursive functions:-           # you might not even write this but it's good to know

# Definition:-
A function that calls itself is a recursive function.

# classic example for recursive function is 'factorial' ---> 1 arg is enough for this
# You might be asked about this function in interviews but you rarely use this in organizations

# $(( )) --> for arithmetic expressions

# refer 'recursive.sh' -----> as the name suggests, it recurses in a loop.
----


# Exercises:-
For both these exercises, use functions & only give 2 args.

For Exercise-1, you can use curl or wget --> refer 'download_file.sh' & '2-download_file.sh' (very minor diff btw these 2 files)

# Note:- chmod -R +x 11/     ---> to give execute permission to all files and subfolders in the directory '11'
