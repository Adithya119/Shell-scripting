### Difference between Parameters & arguments:-

Argument is something which you pass to a script on the command line (on the go).
But if you define that arguement inside the script, it becomes a parameter. --> parameter holds the value of arg.

refer "positional_arg.sh":-
# trainer has defined the parameters inside the script like below (name is parameter-1 & location is parameter-2). Here, parameter-1 holds the value of arg-1 & parameter-2 holds the value of arg-2.

# name=$1
# location=$2

# Arguement & Parameter yield the same result but Parameter looks sophisticated. That's it. Parameters are not mandatory.

### Prompting for user input (interactive script):-

read  # ---> type read & hit enter
Hello   # ---> then type some message

echo $REPLY   # ---> the above message (hello) will be stored "automatically" in a variable called as $REPLY
Hello


# As we go below, we'll see how to get more control on the code:-

read -p "What is your name? "   # ---> type this & hit enter   # give space after ? --> or else you'll have to write your input right after the ? without any space which woould look like --->  What is your name?Adithya
What is your name? Adithya     # ---> "What's your name" is prompted on the screen & you can type your name (Adithya)

echo $REPLY
Adithya


## What if I want to store the user input in some other variable name of my choice rather than in $REPLY ?
read -p "What is your name? " your_name
What is your name? Adithya

echo $your_name
Adithya

# Like this, you can store multiple user inputs in different variables  ---> refer user_input.sh

# Also look at calculator.sh which I have written on my own * * *
