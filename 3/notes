### Difference between Parameters & arguments:-

Argument is something which you pass to a script on the command line (on the go).
But if you define that arguement inside the script, it becomes a parameter. --> parameter holds the value of arg.

refer "positional_arg.sh":-
# trainer has defined the parameters inside the script like below (name is parameter-1 & location is parameter-2). Here, parameter-1 holds the value of arg-1 & parameter-2 holds the value of arg-2.
 
# name=$1
# location=$2

# Arguement & Parameter yield the same result but Parameter looks sophisticated. That's it. Parameters are not mandatory.
