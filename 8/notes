# Looping constructs in bash scripting cont.... ()
3) Counting directories & files (mistakes)
4) Nested Loops
5) Redirecting loop output
6) while and until loops

# mkdir dir{1..10}   To create 10 directories using 1 command

# Whenever you end up seeing script failure, do 'bash -x' to analyse.

3) Counting directories & files (mistakes)

# diff between single & double quotes [[ ]]
# "if-then-elif-then-fi" used inside "for" loop in the 1st script

# Note:
In 1st script, inside the for loop, the "$dir_path" is not 'expanding'. But in 2nd script, it is expanding. (check via bash -x for both scripts).

# Note:
script-1  --->  To check what value(s) is being assign to 'path' in the for loop, give:- echo "processing ${path}" ==> this is just like giving echo $PATH, echo #MAVEN_HOME, echo #JAVA_HOME in Jenkins jobs   ===> useful for troubleshooting purpose.

In script 1, path is being processed as "/home/ubuntu/contents/*"  which is incorrect --> it should expand what's inside that dir.
But in script-2, it is processing all the files/directories inside it.
